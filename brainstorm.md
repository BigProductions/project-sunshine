concept
===============
draft: 0.0.2:
---------------
### child
  -  fights monsters gaining skills or something
### monsters
  -  fight against anything they don't share a connection with.
  -  monsters who kill another including the child collect all of
     the possessions  of the one it killed
  -  if one monster has more stuff all other monsters look to it with
     greed the monster has to keep all the other monsters from killing it,
     otherwise they will kill it and split it's possessions amongst themselves.
### breeding
  -  two creatures of the same who dont kill each other for a while
  -  will grow a likeness at some point even if one of them has more stuff
  -  they wont kill each other. it's at this point if the can the will.
### stuff
  -  clothing
     -  monster silk bloomers
     -  monster silk under top
  -  food

### dungeon
#### objective
   fight monsters
#### structure
  -  series of tunnels and rooms?
  -  magical seals on some doors requireing ... to open them  // maybe?
  -  the deeper you go the stronger the monsters
       wait so each type of monster has finite streagth?  // maybe?
  -  the longer you stay the smarter the monsters
       so the monsters are idiots until you start killing them?  // maybe?
#### monsters
  -  hand designed monster types with set static strengths and weaknesses
   monsters kill everything they can as their objective including their own
   kind
   some kind of monster rebirth system where two not dead monsters intelegence create a new monster
   ... there was more...
#### player
     magical produced at the begining of the game  // ... so that's where baibes come from...
     the cursed child produces a new cursed child from it's dead body  // ... like a phenox?
     the player is born from magic so... the player can use magic?
#### magic
     mp/stanima? I'd like for it to regenerate slowly and if used properly won't run out?
  - **level 1 magic**
       * sheild
           - pushes everything away : uses allot of mp quickly?
       * projectile
           - tiny shield pushed at high speed : like a bullet : size of projectile+speed == mp usage
  - **level 2 magic**
       * plane
           - makes a wall inbetween the player: uses much less mp then shield even when four are used
       * pin
           - uses almost no mp for the projectile all mp goes to velocity passes throught everything
  - **level 3 magic**
       * cube
           - large cube can be used as a sheil small cube can be projected
       * sword
           - mp goes to repair and evaporation as well as the initial creation
  - **level 4 magic**
       * EXPLOSION
           - uses all mp ?regardless? can be appled to anything : size of blast is relative to total mp
  - **level 5 magic**
       * wave of death
           - killes everything player included NO EXCEPTION radius of the death is determined by mp
  - **level 6 magic**
       * death in a box
           - it's contained in a box if the box breaks "wave of death" from the box
         all magic after 3 is uselesss?
  - more notes on magic? ...
##### whaterchesnust
   aren't a part of the game?
   what... why not?

### generative dungeon
      recommended that they were generative in structure
      perhaps an infinite dungeon but have some permanence to it
      I never liked it when the N.P.C.'s or monsters suddenly disappear
      Anything created should be real and shouldn't disappear until it's killed or something...
#### weapons:
  -  melee fighting?
  -  swords arrows magic?
  -  or mid century Victorian rifles steam punk?
