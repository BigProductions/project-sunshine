title:
  optional title one
  project sunshine
  what title
  um...
  what was that other title
  summer sadness
  dosntatter
concept:
  tetris pinball:
    the game would be to bounce peaces into place or something
    or to play tetris and pinball at the same time... ?
    this is probably not the best plan I'm already seeing problems
    problems before the project even starts...
  dungeons:
    recommended that they were generative in structure
    perhaps an infinite dungeon but have some permanence to it
    I never liked it when the N.P.C.'s or monsters suddenly disappear
    Anything created should be real and shouldn't disappear until it's killed or something...
    I'm liking this idea.

    art:
      link to concept art folder
      is the art algorithme baised or are we doing chuncks by hand?
        
    characters:
      designed by player or us?
      
    weapons:
      melee fighting?
      swords arrows magic?
      or mid century Victorian rifles steam punk?
      
    other stuff I have
